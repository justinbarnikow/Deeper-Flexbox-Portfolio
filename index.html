            <p>My name is Justin Barnikow, I'm 25 years old and I'm from Ocean County New Jersey. I grew up in New Jersey but had a 5-year stint in Dallas Texas where I worked as a personal trainer. Dallas is where I grew my career, built character and vision, and met the love of my life; New Jersey is where I've taken these things to grow even further and change my life for the better. With the help of Bloc and other web development educators, I'm excited to begin my new career and see where life takes me. As a husband, dog owner, and hopeful father-to-be, family and the ones I love are my driving, motivating factor that pushes me to work harder than everyone else.</p>

              <h3>Life</h3>
              <hr width="50px">
              <p>As an owner of 3, dogs have been my life for quite a while. I can't see myself living without animals, and would eventually love to have a farm of my own. I'm passionate about working out and staying healthy (previously a personal trainer), and my favorite sport is motocross. I traveled the country for years racing ATVs and meeting an intense variety of people, trying new foods, and seeing great places. Nature is what makes me feel comfortable, so a house on a farm with dogs, other animals, my wife, and a whole lot of woods sounds beautiful to me.</p>

              <h3>Web</h3>
              <hr width="50px">
              <p>My passion and interest in the web started quickly and gained traction quite fast. After I got married, what became important to me was creating a life in which I could both do something I enjoy, and also spend time with my family. This made me dip my toes in the water of coding, and because of this, I'm here today. I took a few beginner courses to see I really felt about coding and the web, and I dove into Bloc shortly thereafter. Because of what I've done in the past, I do feel confident in my ability to work with other great programmers and I am excited to collaborate with people to create incredible projects and designs.</p>
